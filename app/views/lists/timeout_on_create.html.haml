%h1 Time out.

%p We waited for a long time but the Schleuder API didn't answer. This happens sometimes when creating a new list because generating a new OpenPGP key-pair (for the new list) requires a lot of randomness â€” if that's not given, GnuPG just waits until there's more.

%p
  Unfortunately we can't see from here what the issue really is. But chances are that the list was created just fine and in a few minutes the new OpenPGP key-pair will have been generated, too. So please wait a little while and then
  = link_to root_path, 'have a look if your list was created.'
